tickerFullString[5] = "Zoe: Sensy! What're yer doing there?";
tickerFullString[6] = "Sen: I just wanted to check on you since you seemed kinda mad about this hunk of metal. What's up with it?";
tickerFullString[7] = "Zoe: Sen it's... Look, just get down from there yer dipstick! What are you even doing there?!";
tickerFullString[8] = "Sen: Hey, sorry! I just wanted to make sure you were okay... Okay? ...You all right there Zoe...?";
tickerFullString[9] = "Zoe: Yeah I... Look Sen, can we talk for a bit? I'll... explain my reaction earlier...";
tickerFullString[10] = "Sen: Fire away, I'm all ears. Is this thing really that bad? It's just pieces of metal isn't it?";
tickerFullString[11] = "Zoe: It kind of means more than that... It's... Complex. It's really really complex...";
tickerFullString[12] = "Zoe: Just looking at it makes me feel sick... Just a whole bunch of bad memories come right back up...";
tickerFullString[13] = "Zoe: They ain't all bad I guess... For a while, it was just me and my Dad...";
tickerFullString[14] = "Zoe: He had these big, broad arms, like he could pick up mountains with 'em... Big fellah, that's for sure.";
tickerFullString[15] = "Zoe: And he had a kind heart too... He just seemed to be smitten with everything. Goofy grin plastered over his face constantly.";
tickerFullString[16] = "Zoe: He'd spend most of his days tinkerin' outside on these ships... No one could figure out how he got 'em to fly but, he did.";
tickerFullString[17] = "Zoe: Every once a while we'd both go out on them... He was kind of obsessed with finding new land waiting out there...";
tickerFullString[18] = "Zoe: I guess that was the thing huh. He wanted to stretch his wings, to show Verdt what the world had to offer but...";
tickerFullString[19] = "Zoe: No matter how many times he tried, he just ended up back where he started. Yet even that didn't stop him!";
tickerFullString[20] = "Zoe: One day, he just... Vanished. No one knew where he went or what happened to him...";
tickerFullString[21] = "Zoe: It took days before they found the wreckage of his ship smashed across the cliffs... There wasn't any body left to bury...";
tickerFullString[22] = "Zoe: Shortly after that well... My uncle took me under his care and I left Verdt for a while. He was always an outsider, never liked people much.";
tickerFullString[23] ="Zoe: But he was still as kind as his brother, he just didn't show it the same way. But after all this I just kind of felt, sad y'know?";
tickerFullString[24] ="Zoe: Spending the rest of my childhood alone did a number on me... I needed to get out, I needed to return to Verdt to do something worth while!";
tickerFullString[25] ="Zoe: I needed something to strive for. We had a huge argument one day and I just... Well I just left. I went back to Verdt.";
tickerFullString[26] ="Zoe: When I got to my old house, it was as if nothing had changed... If anything, nothing seemed to have even mattered in the first place.";
tickerFullString[27] ="Zoe: The other ships my Father built were just lying disused... I don't know how to explain it but it was like the old dream was just that, a dream.";
tickerFullString[28] ="Zoe: I was an adult and I knew what I wanted, or so I thought... I didn't just want to belong... I kind of wanted to stand out. Selfish right?";
tickerFullString[29] ="Zoe: Maybe I'm sayin' it strange but what I mean is, I wanted to be recognized as something Verdt needed! ...I needed to feel like part of a bigger picture.";
tickerFullString[30] ="Zoe: So. I heard about this Festival, this -thing- that was held every 20 years. I just, dived in. It was perfect. Something out of the ordinary. Unique. Special?";
tickerFullString[31] ="Zoe: Whatever it was, it kind of gave me something to go for! It was always something that was... mysterious? I only heard little bits as a child, so I wanted in.";
tickerFullString[32] ="Zoe: Curious, I consulted the church about it. They spoke in metaphors, said it was something to do with passing from autumn into winter, all very important.";
tickerFullString[33] ="Zoe: It was all about showing how prosperous Verdt was. We were chosen as representations of that kind of thing...";
tickerFullString[34] ="Zoe: I jumped at the chance. It was something rare, something special that happened only once or twice in a lifetime, I had to do it! I just had to...";
tickerFullString[35] ="Zoe: It gave me a purpose so hey, why not jump into it serious like? ...So I became obsessed, I didn't just want to participate, I wanted to be center stage!" 
tickerFullString[36] ="Zoe: ... It's making me feel kinda sick talking about it. I've seen a lot of things and I kinda convince myself I'm okay but, I'm honestly messed up over it...";
tickerFullString[37]= "Zoe: We were just fresh cattle for that monster. Veal. Mutton. Foie Gras, the entire works! For so long we had this weird culture of measuring and cooking and...";
tickerFullString[38]= "Zoe: I'd like to say no one had any idea, but I don't know anymore. But, I was dead-set on this. I rushed out the next morning and bought one of those Training Plates."
tickerFullString[39]= "Zoe: It was as much a mark of pride as it was progress... I felt like I belonged to something, yer know? I kind of embraced that...";
tickerFullString[40]= "Zoe: I had this crazy idea in mind that I could burst the plate in the middle of the Festival, so all the eyes would be on me...";
tickerFullString[41]= "Zoe: Ahahahahah! The looks on their faces! Wow that would have been amazing..."
tickerFullString[42]= "Zoe: ...That sounds so... Disturbing now! But that had been my goal for so long that it was the only thing on my mind! A girl posessed!";
tickerFullString[43]= "Zoe: In honesty, I wanted some kind of escape and this whole Festival gave me that in spades. I literally wanted to show them I was too big for even Verdt I guess?";
tickerFullString[44]= "Zoe: I needed more than just this quiet life to be forgotten so quickly like my Dad was... But well, would you look at me now hey?";
tickerFullString[45]= "Zoe: Guess I am too big for Verdt, literally and figuratively! Give me a week and I bet I could finally break that thing in two! Ahah...Hah..."
tickerFullString[46] ="Zoe: I genuinely hate looking at that girdle... It just represents everything I came to hate about Verdt in the end.";
tickerFullString[47] ="Zoe: Never wanted to get cooped up in that place for too long, and yet there was no way out. No sign of anything else, just Verdt. Just that cage."
tickerFullString[48] ="Zoe: And suddenly yer came on through that scarecrow and wrecked the joint! No one ever saw anything like that since my Uncle way back when!";
tickerFullString[49] ="Zoe: Suddenly, that kind of reminded me about the times I used to fly with my Dad, that kind of feeling where you never knew if you were gonna fall off at any moment.";
tickerFullString[50] ="Zoe: It felt good yer know? Felt like something was happening. I wasn't stuck swimming in a routine anymore, but I was also able to help out with Verdt too.";
tickerFullString[51] ="Zoe: ...And to be honest, yer way more interesting than anyone I ever knew in Verdt. Yer had those free-looking wild eyes you don't get to see back there...";
tickerFullString[52] ="Zoe: Now look at us! Searching the world for other lands, freeing other people from their own cages! I'd never have thought I'd see myself like this in a million years!";
tickerFullString[53] ="Zoe: ..."
tickerFullString[54] ="Sen: ...You did damn well fixing up this ship. I'm amazed this thing can fly, but you done it... I'm pretty sure your old man would be proud of you right now.";
tickerFullString[55] ="Zoe: Yeah. He'd be proud of me no matter what I did or who I was. Same for my Uncle... I miss 'em, Sen... I really, honestly do.";
tickerFullString[56] ="Zoe: But I can either let my regrets hold me back, or try and do them proud. Uncle did us all proud back there... I just wish the others coulda done the same...";
tickerFullString[57] ="Sen: ... At the end of things Zoe, you're not like those other guys. It was the same cage but, you held onto what made you unique through and through all that.";
tickerFullString[58] ="Zoe: ...Yer think so? ...Well, that's the past now. Sen, I'm sorry about reacting like that over that hunk of junk girdle a while ago...";
tickerFullString[59] ="Zoe: It's beyond me now. It can't hold me back anymore, I'm free from it all! ...I'm free...";
tickerFullString[60] ="Zoe: Sen... Thank you for this heart to heart... It really helped me get this off my chest."
tickerFullString[61] ="Zoe: There's a whole lot more healing to do, but I'll get to that in time. We just gotta keep on plowing ahead, right Sensy?";
tickerFullString[62] ="Sen: Right! There's a whole world out there waiting to be found..."
tickerFullString[63] ="Sen: ...We just gotta keep looking."
